# Retail Sales Data Analysis ðŸ“Š

This project is a practice exercise in **Python Data Analysis and Visualization** using:
- Pandas

## Dataset
The dataset (`retail_sales.csv`) contains retail transaction details such as:
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, City)

- Pie Chart: Sales Contribution by City
- Bar Chart: Quantity Sold by Product
- Pie Chart: Payment Method Distribution

### Using Seaborn:
- Scatterplot: Age vs. Spending (by Gender)
- Histogram: Distribution of Purchase Amounts
- Boxplot: Spending by Gender
- Pairplot: Relationships among variables
- Heatmap: Correlation matrix

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
python analysis_matplotlib.py
python analysis_seaborn.py
